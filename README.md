# spring-rest-first-app

# TODO - Only for collaborators
# Add Maven plugins to automate build and deployment
# Create a separate Angular project and invoke rest-app project.
# prefer to use multi-module Maven project.
# Implement Junit test cases to test the service.


# Target Audience: new learners of Spring Rest/Spring Boot


# Steps to launch the application

# 1). Clone or download as zip from Github
       Git clone https://github.com/saidarao-0424/spring-rest-first-app.git
# 2). Import to your favorite IDE of choice ex: Eclipse

# 3). Execute mvn clean install spring-boot:run

# 4). By default Maven tries to run on port 8080, if this port is already using by some other process in your OS. You can change the part by passing vm argument -Dserver.port=9090.


# Note: As this application is using an in memory DB, it's not necessary to install separate DB.

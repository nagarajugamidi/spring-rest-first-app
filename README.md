# spring-rest-first-app

# TODO - Only for collaborators

-->Add Maven plugins to automate build and deployment
-->Create a separate Angular project and invoke rest-app project.
-->Implement Junit test cases to test the service.

# Target Audience: new learners of Spring Rest/Spring Boot

# Steps to launch Application

-->With the installation of rest-parent, it also installs this into our local repo
-->Only thing we need to do is spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=9090
-->By default Maven tries to run on port 8080, if this port is already using by some other process in your OS. You can change the part by passing vm argument -Dserver.port=9090.


# Note: As this application is using an in memory DB, it's not necessary to install separate DB.
